# RedStore-E-Commerce-Website
Complete e-commerce website using Django ,MySQL and HTML and CSS

We have completed all backend part.Our database is connected with our django project and we can add products using django admin page.
We can modify our tables using Django admin page.
We designed the home page of our website using HTML and CSS. We designed it ourselves completely and not importing templates files in our project.
Our frontend part is where we made our difference. We made the whole fron-end with very hard working and also added some responsive elements to it.
What we have not done is local hosting of our website as we are facing some errors and the dynamic part of website is hardly 10% remaining. You can verify by settings.py and urls.py files for verification.
